## Key Testing Features

### Sliding Window Algorithm Validation

The comprehensive test suite specifically validates the true sliding window algorithm:

- **Continuous Window Sliding**: Ensures the 1-hour window slides continuously, not at fixed boundaries
- **Accurate Request Counting**: Verifies precise counting within rolling time windows
- **Boundary Condition Handling**: Tests edge cases at window boundaries
- **Concurrent Request Processing**: Validates atomic operations under high concurrency
- **Time Calculation Accuracy**: Ensures precise reset time calculations
- **Data Cleanup Validation**: Verifies proper cleanup of expired timestamps

### Fallback Mechanism Testing

Tests the in-memory fallback when Redis is unavailable:

- **Graceful Degradation**: Ensures application continues working without Redis
- **Consistent Behavior**: Maintains identical rate limiting logic and limits
- **Memory Management**: Validates proper cleanup and memory usage
- **Error Handling**: Tests graceful handling of Redis connection failures

### Performance and Load Testing

The test suite includes performance validation:

- **High-Frequency Requests**: Tests rapid successive requests
- **Concurrent Processing**: Validates handling of simultaneous requests
- **Memory Usage**: Monitors memory consumption under load
- **Response Times**: Ensures quick response times for rate limit checks

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites

- **Bun**: Runtime and package manager
- **Redis**: For integration tests (requires Docker)
- **Docker Compose**: For running Redis service

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests (unit + fallback)
bun test

# Run specific test categories
bun test tests/security/          # Enhanced unit tests
bun test tests/security/fallback-rate-limiter.test.ts  # Fallback mechanism tests
bun test tests/utils/             # Redis utility tests
bun test tests/integration/       # Redis integration tests
bun test tests/integration/sliding-window.test.ts    # Sliding window algorithm tests

# Run all unit tests (no external dependencies)
bun test tests/security/ tests/utils/

# Run all integration tests (requires Redis)
bun test tests/integration/
```

### Running Integration Tests

Integration tests require Redis to be running:

```bash
# Start Redis service
docker-compose up -d redis

# Run integration tests
bun test tests/integration/
bun test tests/integration/sliding-window.test.ts

# Or run all integration tests
bun test tests/integration/
```

## Test Architecture

### Test Runner (`tests/run-tests.ts`)

The enhanced test runner provides:

- **Sequential Execution**: Tests run in proper order
- **Clear Output**: Easy-to-read results with categorization
- **Summary Reporting**: Total test categories and pass/fail counts
- **Setup Instructions**: Clear guidance for different test types
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of test failures

### Test Structure

Each test file follows a consistent pattern:

```typescript
export function testCategory() {
  console.log('🧪 Testing Category...\n');
  
  let testsPassed = 0;
  let totalTests = X;
  
  // Test cases with try-catch blocks
  try {
    // Test logic
    if (/* test condition */) {
      console.log('✅ Test passed');
      testsPassed++;
    } else {
      console.log('❌ Test failed');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('❌ Test error:', error);
  }
  
  // Results reporting
  console.log(`\n📊 Results: ${testsPassed}/${totalTests} tests passed`);
  return testsPassed === totalTests;
}
```
